# 👋 Hi, I'm Sebastian Silva

👀 I'm interested in backend programming, although I have knowledge in both frontend and backend development.
🦾 I have work experience as a kitchen assistant at Pedidos Ya. Currently, I am actively looking for a job as a junior or full stack developer.
🌱 I am about to finish a full stack programming course and am also taking English courses.
💻 I am proficient in TypeScript, NestJS, NodeJS, JavaScript, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I would love to learn NextJS or Python.
💞️ I have had a meaningful experience helping children in Villa Itatí, Argentina, which gave me a different perspective on life.
🥋 I also volunteer by teaching Kung Fu at a club.
